The development of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has revolutionized the field of machine translation. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in NMT, including its history, architecture, evaluation methods, and applications. The paper starts with a background on machine translation and a brief history of NMT. 

It then discusses the various NMT architectures, such as Encoder-Decoder, Transformer, and Hybrid models, and compares their strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation methods for NMT, including Bleu score, meteor score, and human evaluation, are also covered in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of the various applications of NMT, including its use in multilingual communication, cross-lingual information retrieval, and machine-aided language learning. 

The paper provides insights into the current state-of-the-art NMT systems and identifies future research directions in this field.

## Where we are today

Neural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses an artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modelling entire sentences in a single integrated model. The proposed system uses technologies such as Neural Networks and Attention Mechanism.

The re-discovery of neural networks has provided a significant boost to a variety of subfields within the realm of natural language processing (NLP). But for a considerable amount of time, the incorporation of neural networks into machine translation (MT) systems was just superficial at best.

## There's a better way: Attention Mechanism

Using an artificial neural network to estimate the likelihood of a word sequence and often modelling full sentences in a single integrated model, neural machine translation (NMT) is a method of machine translation. The online application's user can translate spoken or written language by using the algorithms in conjunction with the data in the language database.

The efficiency of the search mechanism may be observed in its capacity to support a trade-off between translation time and search accuracy. This is accomplished by setting the beam size to a reasonably modest value, which in turn ensures that the trade-off is successful. In addition to that, the translator will utilise the symbol when it is unsure about the word that it is translating.
